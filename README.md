StickBattlefield
================

Rogers mobile co-op hackathon project.
StickBattlefield is 3-dimensional action game built off Unity3D.
All development was coded in C#.

#Current state#
At the end of the hackathon I pivoted to create "Balls with Guns" in which the player rolls around with the left joystick and fires lazers with the right button.
These controls can be seen when this project is deployed to an Android device.

#Future steps#
- change player gameobject to a stickman with stickman-like behaviour
- add enemy gameobjects
